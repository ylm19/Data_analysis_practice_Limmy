**001 Hospital Patient Survival - Kaggle**

*Objective*

A hospital in the province of Greenland has been trying to improve its care conditions by looking at historic survival of the patients. They tried looking at their data but could not identify the main factors leading to high survivals. You are the best data scientist in Greenland and they've hired you to solve this problem. Now you are responsible for developing a model that will predict the chances of survival of a patient after 1 year of treatment (Survived_1_year).
